# Sonar XQuery Plugin

This language plugin for the SonarQube code analysis tool (http://sonarqube.org) is intended to work on recent versions of the SonarQube platform (currently version 8.5). It is based on the work of Chris Cieslinkski (https://github.com/malteseduck/sonar-xquery-plugin/) - which was last updated to work on Sonar 4.3. This plugin is a COMPLETE rewrite, and has been written using the Kotlin language.

Currently the XQuery parser in use os from xqDocs (https://github.com/xqdoc/xqdoc), which is based on ANTLR4.  

Documentation and tests will be added in the future.

Feature requests may be created as Issues.
